## Background

I'm a software engineer focused on building reliable, maintainable systems. My work centers on solving real problems through thoughtful design and clean implementation.

## What I Do

I work primarily on backend systems and infrastructure, with experience across the full stack when needed. I value correctness, clarity, and long-term maintainability over quick wins.

### Areas of Focus

- **Systems Design**: Building scalable, fault-tolerant architectures
- **Backend Development**: APIs, data processing, and service integration
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment pipelines, monitoring, and operational tooling
- **Code Quality**: Testing, documentation, and maintainable patterns

## Approach

I believe in:

- **Boring technology** that works reliably over exciting new frameworks
- **Clear documentation** that explains the "why" behind decisions
- **Iterative improvement** based on real-world feedback
- **Honest trade-offs** rather than perfect solutions
